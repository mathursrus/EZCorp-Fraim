## Intent
To create a comprehensive **pricing + packaging strategy** for any product that:

* clarifies who the product is for and what outcomes it delivers,
* defines SKUs, tiers, add-ons, and the pricing metric,
* ties pricing to unit economics and scalability,
* and positions the product clearly against competitors and substitutes.
